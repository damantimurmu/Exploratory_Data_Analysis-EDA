## Structure

- `PDF_report/`: PDF summary report of findings.
- `jupyter/`: Jupyter Notebook performing EDA using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
- `raw_data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `README.md`: Brief Exploratory Data Analysis of Tuberculosis X-Ray Dataset.
- `summary.md`: Summary of Findinga

## Tech Stack

- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PDF Report (Markdown to PDF or nbconvert)

## Key Insights

- Strong associations found between symptoms like **Fever**, **Weight Loss**, and **Fatigue** with TB class.
